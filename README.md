# TextModifier

Program for making changes to a lot of text files in one click

Requires PyQT5 module to run

The program was designed to make a few simple changes to the large quantities of .hop (or .txt) files. These files contain 
information that allows the CNC machine to operate correctly. It is used by custom design furniture Raaschou company in
Copenhagen, Denmark. The machine engineer used to have to do these changes made manually, which was taking the Engineer
on average one hour every week to accoplish. This application allows making changes to large quantities of these files 
in a matter of few clicks, which slightly reduces production costs.
